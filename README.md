# Accordion Block

> The accordion block lets users show and hide sections of content on a page.

## Overview

This block has no styles other than the essentials for toggling the visibility of accordion sections and working without JavaScript support. 
It was heavily inspired on the accordion patterns recommended by the [WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) and the [GOV.UK Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/).
The icons are from [Themify Icons](https://themify.me/themify-icons).
