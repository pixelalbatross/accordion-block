# Accordion Block

> The accordion block lets users show and hide sections of content on a page.

## Description

An accessible, and progressively enhanced accordion block for the WordPress block editor.

No styling is provided other than the essentials for toggling the visibility of accordion sections and working without JavaScript.

It was heavily inspired on the accordion patterns recommended by the [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) and the [GOV.UK Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/).

The icons are from [Themify Icons](https://themify.me/themify-icons).
